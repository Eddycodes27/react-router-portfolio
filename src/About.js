        <h2>About Pancakes</h2>
        <p>Pancakes have been around for centuries and are a 
            staple in many cultures. Experts (pancakes experts?) 
            believe that people enjoyed pancakes as far back as 30,000 
            years ago during the Stone Age. In fact, researchers found 
            pancakes in the stomach of Ötzi the Iceman, famous human 
            remains that date back more than 5,000 years! Actually, 
            that’s kind of gross…

stack-of-pancakesIn ancient Greece and Rome, pancakes were made from 
wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk. Ancient Greek poets 
Cratinus and Magnes wrote about pancakes in their poetry. Shakespeare 
even mentions them in his famous plays. During the English Renaissance, 
people flavored their pancakes with spices, rosewater, sherry, and apples.

People began using the word “pancake” during the 15th century, and 
the word became standard in 19th century America. Previously, people 
referred to them as Indian cakes, hoe cakes, johnnycakes, journey cakes, 
buckwheat cakes, griddle cakes, and flapjacks. Early American pancakes 
were made with buckwheat or cornmeal.

Thomas Jefferson loved pancakes so much that he sent a special recipe 
from the White House to his hometown! We’d love to get our hands on 
that recipe…</p>
